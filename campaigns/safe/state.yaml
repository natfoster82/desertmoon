      Welcome, {operator_name}, to the simulation known as "The Safe".

      On December 21, 1989, at 12:45 AM, corporate spy Sheila Graham gained access to the CEO's office on the 18th floor of Hart Sciences, a pharmaceutical company that would close its doors in disgrace in 1992.

      At 12:51, the combination she entered into the safe results in an immediate alarm and her apprehension by building security.

      In every simulation in which she aborts the mission, her cover is blown the next day and the intel that could eventually save millions of lives is lost.

      Our efforts to brute force the combination have failed, as Sheila has resisted our attempts to subliminally overwrite the combination in her memory.

      We have secured the six minutes between 12:45 and 12:51 for you to observe and guide Sheila in her mission.
